# Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Virtual Experience

Engaged in a virtual experiential learning program offered by Accenture focused on data analytics and visualization.
Assumed the role of a data analyst working in Accenture and as part of a 3 month POC started by Accenture with a social media company named Social Buzz to focus on 3 main tasks, focussed on the last task, that is, conducted an analysis of content categories based on the client data to find insights regarding top 5 most popular categories of content.

In order to conduct analysis on and derive insights from such a vast amount of unstructured data of different types such as audio,video,GIF,photo etc. posted on the social media platform, that is, 100000 posts per day or 36500000 posts per year, the task was approached in 5 main steps:
1. Data understanding: Tried understanding the data model and domain of the business . Chose the three datasets (content, reaction, reaction type CSV files) which were relevant to the analytics task from the data model consisting of 7 datasets provided by Social Buzz.
2. Data cleaning : Cleaned the relevant data sets by removing rows having missing values and removing columns which would not be used in the analysis
3. Data modelling : Merged the above data sets by creating relationships between the datasets based on common columns between each of the datasets to form a final dataset on which analysis could be carried out to uncover insights
4. Data analysis : Found the total sum of the reaction scores corresponding to reaction types for each content category to uncover insights and produced visualizations to describe the insights
5. Uncovering insights : Used these insights to unlock business decisions and to make recommendations on next steps

From the data, it could be observed that travel and science are the two most popular categories of content, showing that people enjoy outdoors and factual content the most.
It can also be observed that food is a common theme within the top 5 categories as healthy eating and cooking are also among the top 5 categories. 
Moreover, it was observed that the maximum amount of content was posted in the months of August and May. 

Recommended the next steps to Social Buzz:
From the above steps, we can recommend to Social Buzz that we take the above analysis into large scale production by focussing on scaling the platform mainly in the months of August and May . It is also recommended that the platform be scaled by focussing mostly on posts based on factual,outdoors and food especially healthy food based content.
